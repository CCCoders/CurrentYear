<h1>Welcome to the Copper Country Coders GitHub page.</h1><br>
<p>This is where you'll come for code provided by your group teachers, to upload your own code, and for most communications regarding code.  We're using GitHub because this is what professional software developers use, and you'll be able to learn how to use it to back up your code and see how you progress through the year. </p>
