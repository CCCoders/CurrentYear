Welcome to TestGroup1.  The teachers are <yourNameHere> and we'll be learning all about Python this semester.
Hold onto your hats because it's going to be a fun year.  We'll start by getting comfortable with printing
things out and later we'll be making games.  If things go really well, we might even start programming a couple
of robots.
